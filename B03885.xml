            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MAy it pleaſe your Majeſty, to accept my thanks for your gracious Act in reſtoring the <hi>Charter,</hi> ſurely your Majeſty was as an Angel to divert Judgment from your Ancient City, the Lord make your Majeſty a Wiſe Phyſician to heal the Wounds of this Nation, and I doubt not but that your Majeſty has the Nature of an Indulgent Father, who values the Lives and Intereſt of his Children before the Gain of the World. Therefore I humbly beſeech your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to make Peace, for <hi>Bleſſed is the Peace maker,</hi> for why ſhould War obtain that which Peace may do, for it is very deſtructive, and the Winner may prove a Looſer, and it was the Councel of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our who Exhorted his Diſciples to agree with their Adverſaries whilſt they were in the Way. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I intreat Your Majeſty, to ſatisfie the <hi>Dutch</hi> if poſſible, for I find all men in general and willing to fight for your Majeſty; but your Majeſty cannot blame us if we are not willing to fight for <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they own ſuch Doctrin as Chriſt and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples never taught, to Judge all to be Heretical and Damn'd but their ſelves, and yet at the ſame time own themſelves Catholick Chriſtians, which is a clear Contradiction, therefore there is a neceſſity they ſhould renounce ſuch Errours as theſe are, to give ſome aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that whilſt we fight your Majeſties Battel, we may not promote theirs; then I dare to Promiſe your Majeſty Victory, for we ſhall have the Spirits of Engliſh Men to fight your Battel, but <hi>Rome</hi> darkens your Glory, and the fear of <hi>Popery</hi> has been the ſole Cauſe of all our Differences; I do not condemn all <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> for I really think that there is Brave and Worthy Men amongſt them that will be precious in Gods ſight, but yet I think they do not wiſely to ſtand in oppoſition againſt Chriſt Intentions, for he never intended to Exalt the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> but to make God All in All; that we throught him and for his ſake might obtain the hopes of Salvation. Oh! that it would pleaſe God that our Differences were at an end that we might have an happy Unity, which is the Prayer of your humble Subject, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and Souls Well wiſher.</p>
